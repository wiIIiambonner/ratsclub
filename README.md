# About me

I'm **Victor Freire**, a student and software developer based in **Guarulhos,
Brazil**, currently working at [Grupo SBF](https://ri.gruposbf.com.br/) as a
software engineer writing Go and Python.

I've taught myself coding, cloud computing and linux for years, out of passion.
At the moment I'm mostly interested in learning about highly scalable systems.

My projects live at [sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~glorifiedgluer) and
[GitHub](https://github.com/ratsclub), you can also contact me via
[email](mailto:victor@freire.dev.br),
